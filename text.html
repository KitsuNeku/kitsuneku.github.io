    <p>"<b>They shall be my finest warriors</b>, these men who give of themselves to me. Like clay <strong>I shall mould them </strong>and in the furnace of war I <small>shall forge them.</small></p>
    <p>They shall be of iron will and steely sinew. <sub>In great armour</sub> I shall clad them and with <sup>the mightiest weapons</sup> shall they be armed.</p>
    <p>They will be <u>untouched by plague or disease</u>; no <i>sickness</i> shall blight them. They shall have such <em>tactics, strategies and machines</em> that no foe will best them in battle.</p>
    <p>They are my bulwark against the <del>Terror</del>.</p>
    <p><mark> They are the Defenders of Humanity. </mark></p>
    <p><i>They are my Space Marines...and they shall know no fear.</i>"</p>
