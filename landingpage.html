            <h1 class="mb-3">Welcome Gue'vesa</h1>
            <p class="mb-4">This is the Tau Empire a relatively young civilization in the 40k universe, yet they have made their presence known via great technological achievements. On the Eastern Fringe of the galaxy, a they have emerged to challenge the might of the Imperium of Man and the other established races in the 41st millennium. They are a surprisingly advanced civilization that has organized itself around a single guiding principle known as "The Greater Good." By setting aside individualism to serve the needs of society as a whole, the Tau Empire has developed and expanded at an astounding rate. In just over 6,000 years, they evolved from savanna dwelling primitives to space-faring colonists.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"> This unhindered progress has given the Tau confidence that there is no obstacle that their society and their science cannot overcome. Indeed, they believe that they can help the rest of the galaxy find their way to peace and prosperity. All the other races must do is accept the Greater Good and obey the Ethereals, the mysterious Tau leaders.</p
            <p class="mb-4">Not surprisingly, the established races have other plans. To help "bring them around," the Tau have invented some of the most lethal ranged weaponry in Warhammer 40,000. Their basic troop type, called Fire Warriors, are armed with pulse rifles and carbines that penetrate armor like a comet through a dust cloud.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Pulse weapons would be devastating enough, but the Tau also have powered armor and anti-gravity vehicles galore. Their Crisis and Stealth battlesuits have unrivaled mobility on the battlefield, popping out from behind cover, firing a thunderous barrage, and disappearing again before the enemy can react. The Tau's Hammerhead and Skyray gunships, along with XV88 Broadside battlesuits, pound opposing forces to bits while their Devilfish Troop Carriers reposition Fire Warriors for better shots. At a distance, the Tau can lay waste to all but the hardiest of enemies.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Yet the Tau disdain up-close fighting and are unskilled in hand-to-hand combat. They have hired the mercenary Kroot and inducted the insectoid Vespid to make up for this lack, but the Tau still try to avoid close-quarter engagements. Despite this limitation, the Tau are an emerging force in the galaxy that the established races cannot ignore.</p>
